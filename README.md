# Chrome-Extension
## This is the first time I am working on building extensions so to understand I am starting with simple HTML
### Here I have created the frontend part with html,css and JavaScript but I am not able to figure out how to click images of the candidate in a fixed time interval and send it to cloudinary once i will achieve that I can easily display the images to the dashboard.
### Once I achieve the above I can switch to react as frontend ,node as backend and mongoDB for database.
